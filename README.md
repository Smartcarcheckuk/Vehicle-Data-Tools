- Sample JSON structures for vehicle data  
- Example Python scripts for handling VIN and plate lookups  
- Notes on integrating vehicle history APIs into apps and websites  

## Why Vehicle Data Matters

Accurate vehicle data helps buyers, sellers, and businesses make smarter decisions. By validating MOT history, checking mileage discrepancies, and ensuring vehicles are free from outstanding finance, developers can create apps that improve trust in the used car market.  

## Example Code

```python
# sample Python snippet
vehicle = {
    "plate": "AB12CDE",
    "make": "Ford",
    "model": "Fiesta",
    "year": 2018,
    "mileage": 45200,
    "finance_check": False
}

print("Vehicle Lookup:", vehicle)
